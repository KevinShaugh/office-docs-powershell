# Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet will assign a phone number to a user or a resource account (online application instance).

**Note**: The cmdlet is currently not supported for customers and tenants that are or have been enabled for Regionally Hosted Meetings for Skype for Business Online. These
customers should continue to use the Set-CsUser, Set-CsOnlineVoiceUser, Set-CsOnlineApplicationInstance, or Set-CsOnlineVoiceApplicationInstance cmdlets.

## SYNTAX

### Assignment (Default)
```powershell
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity <String> -PhoneNumber <String> -PhoneNumberType <String> [-LocationId <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Attribute
```powershell
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity <String> -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled <Boolean> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet assigns a phone number to a user or resource account. When you assign a phone number the EnterpriseVoiceEnabled flag is automatically set to True.

To remove a phone number from a user or resource account, use the [Remove-CsPhoneNumberAssignment](Remove-CsPhoneNumberAssignment.md) cmdlet.

If the cmdlet executes successfully, no result object will be returned. If the cmdlet fails for any reason, a result object will be returned that contains a Code string parameter
and a Message string parameter with additional details of the failure.


## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity user1@contoso.com -PhoneNumber +12065551234 -PhoneNumberType CallingPlan
```
This example assigns the Microsoft Calling Plan phone number +1 (206) 555-1234 to the user user1@contoso.com.

### Example 2
```powershell
$loc=Get-CsOnlineLisLocation -City Vancouver
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity user2@contoso.com -PhoneNumber +12065551224 -PhoneNumberType CallingPlan -LocationId $loc.LocationId
```
This example finds the emergency location defined for the corporate location Vancouver and assigns the Microsoft Calling Plan phone number +1 (206) 555-1224 and location 
to the user user2@contoso.com.

### Example 3
```powershell
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity user3@contoso.com -EnterpriseVoiceEnabled $true
```
This example sets the EnterpriseVoiceEnabled flag on the user user3@contoso.com.

### Example 4
```powershell
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity user3@contoso.com -LocationId 'null' -PhoneNumber +12065551226 -PhoneNumberType OperatorConnect
```
This example removes the emergency location from the phone number for user user3@contoso.com.

### Example 5
```powershell
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity cq1@contoso.com -PhoneNumber +14255551225 -PhoneNumberType DirectRouting
```
This example assigns the Direct Routing phone number +1 (425) 555-1225 to the resource account cq1@contoso.com.

### Example 6
```powershell
Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity user4@contoso.com -PhoneNumber "+1425551000;ext=100" -PhoneNumberType DirectRouting
```
This example assigns the Direct Routing phone number +1 (425) 555-1000;ext=100 to the user user4@contoso.com.

### Example 7
```powershell
$pn=Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment -Identity user5@contoso.com -PhoneNumber "+1425551000;ext=100" -PhoneNumberType DirectRouting
$pn
Code       Message
----       -------
BadRequest Telephone Number '+1425551000;ext=100' has already been assigned to another user
```
In this example the assignment cmdlet fails, because the phone number "+1425551000;ext=100" has already been assigned to another user.


## PARAMETERS

resource account.

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LocationId
The LocationId of the location to assign to the specific user. You can get it using Get-CsOnlineLisLocation.

"tel:" prefixed. We support Direct Routing numbers with extensions using the formats +1206555000;ext=1234 or 1206555000;ext=1234.

Setting a phone number will automatically set EnterpriseVoiceEnabled to True.

```yaml

Required: False
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None

## OUTPUTS

### System.Object

## NOTES
The cmdlet is available in Teams PowerShell module 3.0.0 or later.

If a user or resource account has a phone number set in Active Directory on-premises and synched into Microsoft 365, you can't use Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment to set the phone
number. You will have to clear the phone number from the on-premises Active Directory and let that change sync into Microsoft 365 first.

The previous command for assigning phone numbers to users Set-CsUser had the parameter HostedVoiceMail. Setting HostedVoiceMail for Microsoft Teams users is no longer
necessary and that is why the parameter is not available on Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment.
